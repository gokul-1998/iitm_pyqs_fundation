-  Floyd-Warshall algorithm 
- to a graph with a negative weightcycle.
- Bellman-Ford algorithm is used for single source shortest path.
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used for all pair shortest paths.

- how to find if a function is continuous or not.

-  one-to-one function, onto function, and inverse function.

- one-to-one function: A function f is said to be one-to-one (or injective), if for every y in the codomain of f, there is exactly one x in the domain of f such that f(x) = y.
- onto function: A function f is said to be onto (or surjective), if for every y in the codomain of f, there is at least one x in the domain of f such that f(x) = y.
